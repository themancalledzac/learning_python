# Instructions
# You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name


import random

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(names)
length = len(names)
print(length)
choice = random.randint(0, length - 1)
final = names[choice]
print(f"The person paying is {final}")


# further reference, we could instead do

person_who_will_pay = random.choice(names)
print(f" {person_who_will_pay} is going to pay")
