# Object Model

## Two most important things that make up an object:

- Attributes

  - Variables that are associated with the modeled object
  - Attached to that object, aka a Waiter's attributes, not necessarily Sarah's variable

- Methods

  - Functions
  - We call it a method, however, because it is a function that a particular Object can DO
  - aka: A waiter can take an order, can Take payment.

- Trying to model real life objects
  - those objects HAVE things and can DO things.

# Class

## Class vs Object

- A class is the blueprint for our object.

- An Object is what is constructed from our blueprint

- Syntax

  - car = CarBlueprint()
    - Here we see a car object being constructed from the Car Blueprint, our Class.
